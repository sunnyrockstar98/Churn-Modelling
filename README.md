# Churn-Modelling

The annual percentage at which customers start exiting a bank is referred to as Churn Rate of a bank.

I here use the data I have of 10,000 customers of a bank to predict wether they will exit the bank or not.

I use details like wether the customer has a credit card, his/her balance, credit history and score, salary, age, gender, tenure, etc to predict wether the customer would leave the bank or not.

For this modelling of the Churn Rate I use the XGBoost model to train and predict.
I have provided the training and test sets.
